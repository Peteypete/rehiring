# re-hiring

My Javascript/mxWeb&trade; ["AskHN: Who Is Hiring"](https://github.com/kennytilton/whoshiring) browser ported to CLJS/[re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame). Search and annotate the hundreds of jobs listed every month.

[Now residing in my [re-frame fork](https://github.com/kennytilton/re-frame/tree/master/examples/rehiring).]
